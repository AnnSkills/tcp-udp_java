 English is a West Germanic language of the Indo-European language family, originally spoken by the inhabitants of early
medieval England. It is named after the Angles, one of the ancient Germanic peoples that migrated to the area
of Great Britain that later took their name, England. Both names derive from Anglia, a peninsula on the Baltic Sea which
is not to be confused with East Anglia, the Eastern part of England which comprises the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex.
English is most closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon, while its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by
other Germanic languages, particularly Old Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as Latin and French.
English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English, a group of West Germanic
(Ingvaeonic) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century, are collectively called Old English.
Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England; this was a period in which
English was influenced by Old French, in particular through its Old Norman dialect.[9][10] Early Modern English
began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London, the printing of the
King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift West.
